Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. 

 View the Live Site Here→ https://misahwan.github.io/Portfolio/

This is a custom-built static website designed to showcase my work, technical skills, and background in systems architecture. To keep the codebase lightweight and highly optimized, the layout was engineered entirely from scratch utilizing modern CSS Grid and Flexbox, without relying on heavy UI frameworks.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore my other repositories or reach out to connect.
